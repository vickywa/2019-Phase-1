# Part 2 - Power BI
In this subsection, our main purpose is to build a dynamic report in Power BI.

Let me go through the agenda of this video. First, we are going to have a quick discussion on what is a dataset? And what is a good dataset for us to build a dynamic report which can pull out the most useful insight from your data source. We will also have a look at the life cycle of data analysis. To get you ready with powerbi download and signup   Then to start your journey with PowerBI, I’ll quickly go through how you can use your personal email to sign in with PowerBI. Then we will start to first import a dataset from Azure databricks which you have learned from part1. Once the dataset has been successfully imported, we shall start to build our first dynamic report in power BI desktop!

First, I’m going to ask you a question. What is a dataset? According to Wikipedia, the official definition of a dataset is a collection of data. This means, any information which been collected are data source. It can be a traditional excel file with rows and columns. It also can be an article/ text file or even  a picture. However. In our discussion today, we are only going to use the most common data source which is structured dataset. Such as, your excel file, a table, or any rectangular shape data that comes with rows and columns. Okay, the same human beings we need a place to stay, the dataset needs to been store in somewhere as well. The most common ways to store your data are a database or your local machine or most popular recently is store them in the cloud which is what you have learned from partA as well. The dataset we are going to use today is extracted from Azure cloud. Then we can make predictions, visualisation to extract insights from the dataset.

Now let’s go through a life cycle of data analysis. And I’m going to use cooking as an example. It’s five o’clock in the evening and you want to make some dinner. First you will go to the kitchen and check what in your fridge and pick out the raw material that you are going to cook tonight. Then you will need to clean them. Then chop your veges and meat into desire shape and then cook them together add seasoning and maybe some chilli too add some different flavour. Finally, you will have a table full of dishes!! I think this is the exact same process as data analysis using Power BI. First you will extract useful data from your original data source. Then you have to cleaning your dataset. Since the real world dataset mostly are not perfect. Then you may transform your data to the desire format or add additional information based on your current dataset. Then usually you will create some data visuals to pull out insights. Gathering all visuals together you built your dynamic report!
